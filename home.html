					This build is a high-end gaming computer. It features an Intel i7 processor, an
					NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU, and 16GB of RAM. The computer was designed to allow the user to play
					video games at the maximum graphics settings, while still maintaing high frame rates and
					allowing for smooth gameplay. The computer boasts a 1TB SSD for large storage capacity and
					quick reading and writing to storage. Although pricy, the computer's strong performance
					is well worth the money.

				<p>
					This build is a basic computer designed for every-day use. Although the parts
					in it are not high-end, they are cost efficient. The computer contains an
					Intel i5 processor, 1TB HDD, and 8GB of RAM. It does not contain a graphics
					card, so it will not be very powerful for playing video games, but it is
					definitely good for every-day use such as browsing the internet and running
					various programs.
